Marinade Finance has a TVL of $1.24 billion, whereas Jito had a TVL of $726 million.  Jito (JTO) has a higher market capitalization and token price than Marinade Finance (MNDE), which means it has more demand and valuation.   So, it has less marketcap but it is more expensive.  Jito (JTO) offers a lower annual percentage yield (APY) than Marinade Finance (MNDE), which means it has less rewards for staking Solana (SOL). 6.9% APY for jito versus 9.1% APY for marinade.  Jito (JTO) has some additional features that Marinade Finance (MNDE) does not have, such as its block building engine and MEV infrastructure, which could give it an edge in the long term. Jito also had a successful token launch and airdrop, which boosted its popularity and exposure.  Sentiment is on jito's side and it is on binance and coinbase, but marinade is only on coinbase.

Again, this was the case after coming into the SOL ecosystem during the last bull run where I just couldn't help piling money into various low caps in the hope of finding the holy grail. I've played a lot with defi platforms across SOL,ETH,DOT and the fact is that SOL stands head and shoulders above all others in terms usability and already is incredibly diverse with exciting projects that actually have interesting utilities. I've had my eye and stake in projects like MEDIA, PYTH, LIKE, ATLAS with MEDIA in particular having a lot of upside potential and seems to be on the move. I wonder if anyone has other tokens backed with real utility that could be exciting to get into? Likewise, I'd be very interested if there are other defi networks that people have had particularly good experiences with?   Of course I will still be having a flutter on coins like bonk and samo but as this is not a viable ""investment strategy"" and I am already concerned by the up tick in shilling of useless stuff like dogs with hats and the like. I don't want to see the community burned by rug pulls because SOL can offer us all so much more!",r/solana

Considering the historical data and current market dynamics, what are your thoughts on the maximum potential value that $BONK could achieve in a similar bull run scenario? It would be interesting to discuss the factors that could influence its peak value, such as market sentiment, investor behavior, and any significant technological or community developments around $BONK.  Also, I'm curious to hear your perspectives on how the performance of $SHIB during the last bull run might correlate with the future potential of $BONK.

After all the aggregator is nearly tied with Solana so I hope it wont be a problem. Well let's now get to the issue. I just started to use the Jupiter swap APIs, but I have one problem with them. It is terribly slow. The code does work, it will swap, but 9 out of 10 times it will time out and I don't know why. I tried to find out where the code gets stuck and it is on the following code:  `await connection.confirmTransaction(txid);` Why could that be? I have also used different RPC endpoints, for example the Helius one, and it was still super slow. I have also made a ""race"" between trying to swap in in the Jupiter GUI using my custom Helios RPC endpoint and my code with the same Helios RPC endpoint and the GUI was significantly faster.

46,Your input and support very much appreciated - how to make Solana community meme coin tradable on DEX,18qja2p,CoinDino,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/18qja2p/your_input_and_support_very_much_appreciated_how/,5,6,2023-12-25 15:04:02,"   Hello fellow crypto enthusiasts and Merry Christmas!  Myself and 3 peers, all with a tech, but non-coding marketing background, want to launch a cool project on Solana, a community meme token with some real energy and fun behind it to accelerate the rocket! Don’t get us wrong, we don’t expect to be rich, we don’t want to rug pull the token, we just want to have fun and learn how to create a token and grow the community. It's awesome to have your own tradable token, maybe earn something along the way and also give some of the value to charities.   By reading, learning and doing, our ‘dream’ is to launch a successful, tradable meme token project on Solana. We think Solana has one of the better chances to succeed in the crypto scene. After we set up a SOL wallet, did some trading and experimenting, we were impressed by the speed of the blockchain network and the active community. Good chance Solana will rock during the coming bull market.   So what did we do so far and for what we ask for your input and help?  What we did so far:  1. Figured out how to create a token on Solana. This is now done. We can share more info about the project once we have some more answers on the below. 2. We created a Twitter account, website, Discord channel, Telegram, Youtube channel, Instagram & more. Website is finalized, Twitter and other social media channels need to be filled with content.  3. We created, paid for, and now have a Market ID in order to create a Liquidity Pool on Raydium.   Where we need your input and support:  * We want to make the coin tradable and list it on e.g. Coinmarketcap and Coingecko. To make the coin tradable, our thoughts are to first list it on a DEX like Raydium. We have the Market ID, so we are now able to create our Liquidity Pool. However, we now have some questions concerning Liquidity, Project Launch and Scambots . Raydium Telegram/Discord is not really supportive and not much information is found on the internet:  Radium says the following:  *Starting Price, Initial Liquidity and Start time:*   *1) Set the Base Token starting price: This is the number of Quote Tokens needed to purchase 1 Base Token.*   *2) Set Base and Quote token initial liquidity: You can enter one side of initial liquidity and the other side will be calculated according to the Base Token starting price. 3)Set the start date and time that you want your pool to launch. Ensure that you have adequate funds in your wallet for this initial liquidity, then click 'Confirm and Initialize Liquidity Pool'.*  → You cannot set the starting price. The only thing we can do is for example choose to add 300M of our meme token ‘X’ to the liquidity pool as a base token. Our quote token of choice is USDC.   We are not rich, so we can only add limited amount of USDC. Let’s say you want to add 500 USDC, this is the deciding factor in what the Base Token starting price will become:  500 USDC/300M X = start price 0,000001667 USDC/X  Questions we have:  1. If you can’t add too much liquidity in USDC from the start, is it easy for 1 person to just buy all the coins and ‘kill the project’ (no liquidity left)? 2. We read stories about people starting their coin LP and they added quite some liquidity (e.g. 10 SOL or 5k USDC) and they lost it all to bots manipulating their coins. How can you prevent this from happening? Just not add too much liquidity? What is the effect on the LP? 3. What would be your suggestion taking the above in consideration in how to start the LP on Raydium? Let’s say you have close to, but below, 1 Billion token X. How much X would you put in the pool and how much USDC would you put in the pool? 4. Any other tips on how you would continue the roadmap? What DEX or CEX would you go to next to try to make coin X tradable? What should you keep in mind if you want to take this action?  Any input is highly appreciated. Hopefully this can be the start of a fruitful discussion on how to have a fair chance starting a successful new project on Solana. We want to make this a community project, so we’re looking for volunteers/team members and other enthusiasts to grow the token and the community. We can reward you in token airdrops if you can help us to the next stage of the project!  Thanks and Merry Christmas again!",r/solana
47,LIQUIDITY REMOVE SCAM IN SOLANA ALT COINS !,18qj4qf,moonxxwolf,https://www.reddit.com/r/solana/comments/18qj4qf/liquidity_remove_scam_in_solana_alt_coins/,7,6,2023-12-25 14:55:22,I have been trading solana meme coins in this hype season where i came across this new variation of the scam where they launch a new meme coin with small liquidity and drain it after few minutes.     I've been a developer for a while now but i've only worked in core ETH ecosystem. I would like to understand that if the scammer made the amount that is displayed on transaction (which is roughly doubled the money) or they got few sol of profit on top of their investment.      I have this confusion coz i checked transactions on solscan . and it only indicates the SOL/USDC transactions as valuable transactions. I need to know if alt tokens are worth something or It is useless after liquidity is pulled. since alt tokens are sitting still in scammer wallet.      If anybody can help me understand this it would be great. i am trying to build something to prevent this.,r/solana

With the community, which are considered future ideas for the network. 🗽🎇🎆🤠✌️  Let's talk real for a sec. We all love the blazing-fast speeds, low fees, and endless memes Solana throws our way. But as this ecosystem explodes, something crucial is missing: a dedicated, thriving community space. 👽  Sure, we gather in Discord servers and Telegram groups, flinging GIFs and shilling the next mooning project. But these channels are fragmented, chaotic, and often plagued by bots and noise. We need something better, something that transcends the surface-level hype and fosters genuine connection, learning, and collaboration. 🏟️  Imagine a Solana Sanctuary, a platform built not just for trading and shilling, but for deep dives into DeFi protocols, educational workshops, hackathons, and artist showcases. A place where seasoned builders mentor eager noobs, where artists mint their masterpieces amidst supportive cheers, and where the future of decentralized finance is debated and shaped by the collective SolMind. 🎎  This isn't just a pipe dream, SolFam. Look at Ethereum with its vibrant Devcon conferences and active forums. Look at Polkadot's thriving ambassador program. These communities aren't just marketing gimmicks – they're the lifeblood of innovation, the fertile ground where the next groundbreaking dApps sprout. 🧫  Solana deserves the same. We need a central hub for Sol enthusiasts, a place where the technical wizardry meets the artistic soul, where the memes mingle with meaningful discussions, and where the future of Web3 is co-created, not just speculated on. ☕  This isn't just a call to action for the Solana devs, but for every member of this incredible community. Let's start creating, building, and collaborating. Let's turn the SolFlare into a beacon of shared knowledge and creativity. Let's show the world what happens when a passionate community unites behind a revolutionary blockchain. 🧑‍💻  #SolanaCommunity #SolanaSanctuary #BeyondTheMemeMine #BuildTheFuture #solana  P.S.
